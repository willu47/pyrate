pyrate - the Python AIS Tools Environment
=========================================

Pyrate is a software architecture and suite of algorithms for the analysis of
`AIS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System>`_
data originating from ship-borne transceivers and collected by satellites
and shore-based receivers.
The different tools engage in an efficient and modular way,
hence they are substitutable and extendable in a dynamic fashion.
The primary goal is to validate and clean the dataset,
extract information on shipping patterns and shipping routes.
To make information easily discoverable, the data is stored in a variety of
database types and formats.
